# Game Modes Analysis: Main Branch vs Testing Integration Branch

## 🎯 Executive Summary

After examining all four game modes in the application, I've identified significant regressions, feature deletions, and inconsistencies introduced during the integration process. The testing branch has simplified many sophisticated features from the main branch, resulting in degraded user experience.

**🆕 UPDATE**: Major restorations completed! HumanEvaluationArena and HumanMachineArena have been fully restored to main branch functionality.
