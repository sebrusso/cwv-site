   - **Files:** middleware.ts, arena components, auth routes

4. **✅ MoreAPIRoutes** - `origin/codex/add-api-routes-for-sessions,-activity-log,-feedback`
   - **Status:** MERGED with new API endpoints
   - **Resolution:** Added experience-feedback API, kept enhanced existing routes
   - **Key Benefits:** Extended API functionality for user feedback
   - **Files:** experience-feedback route

### Tier 2: Core Evaluation & Leaderboard Logic
5. **✅ EvalSaveLogic** - `origin/codex/modify-model-evaluation-saving-logic`
   - **Status:** MERGED with model leaderboard enhancements
   - **Resolution:** Integrated enhanced evaluation saving logic
   - **Key Benefits:** Improved model evaluation workflow
   - **Files:** model-leaderboard route, tests

6. **✅ SpeedLeaderboard** - `origin/codex/implement-speed-mode-leaderboard-api-and-ui`
   - **Status:** MERGED with speed rankings
   - **Resolution:** Added comprehensive speed mode leaderboard
   - **Key Benefits:** Speed performance tracking and leaderboard UI
   - **Files:** speed-mode-leaderboard API, leaderboard page, tests

7. **✅ EvalSaveLeaderboard** - `origin/codex/update-evaluation-saving-logic-and-leaderboard`
   - **Status:** MERGED (Most Complex - High Risk)
   - **Resolution:** Kept main branch's sophisticated implementations
   - **Key Benefits:** Comprehensive evaluation and leaderboard system updates
   - **Files:** Multiple API routes, comprehensive leaderboard logic

### Tier 3: Configuration & Enhancement Features
8. **✅ Config Features** - Multiple config branches
   - **Status:** ALREADY INTEGRATED
   - **Branches:** 
     - `add-config-file-for-system-instructions`
     - `add-config-for-date-range-visibility-on-leaderboard`
     - `add-dataset_downloads-table-and-tracking`
   - **Resolution:** These were already present in main branch

9. **✅ UI/UX Improvements**
   - **Status:** ALREADY INTEGRATED
   - **Branches:**
     - `normalize-styles-across-modes`
     - `refactor-ai-integration-for-modular-architecture`
   - **Resolution:** These enhancements were already incorporated

## 🚫 Redundant Features (Successfully Avoided)

### Already Merged to Main (Not Re-merged)
- ✅ ScrollHandler (TextPane scroll improvements)
- ✅ PageViews (Page view logging)
- ✅ LeaderboardColumnFix (Model quality leaderboard columns)
- ✅ UserEvents (Event tracking system)
- ✅ SpeedModeScores (Speed mode scoring foundation)
- ✅ SpeedArena (Speed mode competition UI)
- ✅ UserPerfChartSpeed (Speed score charts)
- ✅ LogEvalActivity (Evaluation activity logging)
- ✅ AnonymousSession (Anonymous session handling)
- ✅ ActivityLogAuth (Activity logging with auth)

**Result:** Successfully avoided 10 redundant merges, preventing conflicts and code duplication.

## 📊 Integration Statistics

- **Total Commits:** 19 commits on testing-integration-v2
- **Major Merges:** 7 successful feature merges
- **Conflicts Resolved:** ~15 merge conflicts resolved intelligently
- **Code Quality:** Preserved main branch's sophisticated implementations
- **Test Coverage:** Maintained and extended test infrastructure

## 🎯 Conflict Resolution Strategy - Highly Successful

### High-Risk Files Successfully Managed:
1. **`src/contexts/UserContext.tsx`** - Preserved enhanced auth system
2. **API routes** - Maintained sophisticated implementations
3. **Test files** - Extended coverage while preserving structure
4. **Package management** - Cleanly resolved dependency conflicts
5. **Middleware** - Enhanced route protection with auth bypass support

### Resolution Approach That Worked:
- **Smart Analysis:** Understood which branch had more sophisticated implementations
- **Preserve Functionality:** Kept advanced features from both branches when possible
- **Immediate Testing:** Validated resolutions after each major conflict
- **Documentation:** Recorded all significant resolution decisions

## 🏗️ Current State

### Testing Branch: `testing-integration-v2`
- **Status:** Ready for comprehensive testing
- **Location:** Local and pushed to origin
- **Features:** All target features successfully integrated
- **Next Steps:** Quality assurance testing

### Build Status:
- **Minor Issues:** Some Next.js route export issues (being addressed)
- **Core Functionality:** All major features integrated successfully
- **Test Infrastructure:** Enhanced and comprehensive

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Quality Assurance Phase:**
